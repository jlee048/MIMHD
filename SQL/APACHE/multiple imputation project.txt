Multiple Imputation Applied to Real World Datasets for the imputation of Missing Health Data

Scope of Research/objectives
1. Evaluate multiple imputation approaches on real world datasets 
2. Investigate if there any significant improvement in the predictive performance of imputed datasets

or mainly just...

Investigate whether there is significant improvement in the predictive performance of models on real world datasets after they have been trained using with imputed datasets

3. Multiple Imputation approaches in scope - MissForest, MIDAS, maybe Mi? So far we have had little luck getting it to work with significant datasets. Should we look at MiCE if we have time?
4. Imputing Apache II related physiological metrics (12 of them) on patients > 16 using MIMIC III ICU admissions data with the aim of improving in-hospital mortality prediction
5. Imputing ASA code of operations performed on patients > 16 using NMDS (MoH) with the aim of improving in-hospital mortality prediction

Methodology

1. Clean and Prep ->inconsistensies, outliers, transformations (age, length of stay, time-based and other binary indicators)
2. diagnosis 
	a. mimic-> recode icd9 primary and secondary diagnoses to 21 levels categorical factors
	b. moh -> recode diags into chapters and blocks etc
3. filter for >= 16 years at admission + has chart event data
4. impute using algos like missforest, midas to create imputed dataset
does distribution of ASA need to be considered?
note we also need to impute whether Emergency or not.


Prediction part - we want to compare imputed with non imputed 
(i.e. three datasets, one imputed and two non imputed datasets, 1st one remove missing, 2nd one substitute with acceptable value)
1. validate datatypes - ints, numerics, strings, categoricals
2. create training and test data 
	a. consider case control sampling, stratification? do we need to oversample for mortality?
3. filter post event features from dataset e.g. length of stay etc
4. handle missing data for non imputed datasets
for mimic physiological, do we use mean of normal range? or just mean?
for moh? will need to substitute with a meaningful value?

5 pick a range of classification algorithms5
b.use cross validation to pick best performing 3?

6.apply and tune models
7.score evaluate

Questions about prediction methodology
1. What should i report on the imputation phase? since we are not poking holes artificially, we are not comparing with "TRUE" datasets OR should I go poke holes in a complete dataset if time permits? Or should I focus more on the prediction part? i.e. do i need to focus on effectiveness in imputing missing health data?
Note 14370 first admissions have complete data, 21453 first admissions have some missingness

2. what should i be focusing/maximising when tuning models? AUC? Recall? Precision, etc?

3. With Mimic, Ratio of non-inHospitalmortality to inHospitalmortality is 8 to 1 (31987 to 3886). Does this mean case controlled sampling or similar is required?

4. We have lots of binary indicators incl outcome. Should this be coded as integers or factors within R? Reason being missForest warns  about doing regression over variables having less than 5 unique values but... training time "seems" to be longer after setting them as factors.

5. With MoH, complete to incomplete data ratio is roughly 1:2 (missing ASA)
Mortality to non mortality is 16176 to 2200428 ~ about 0.74%. Again, do we need case controlled sampling for classification prediction

6. Any problems with tech? ie AzureML
